# OpenSpan RDA monitoring through `filebeat`

## How OpenSpan RDA works

In this example, we would like to ship the log files generated by OpenSpan RDA into elastic. As RDA is a desktop tool that can run standalone without server based component or back-end, it becomes paramount to deploy a very light agent in each desktop whose sole role will be to ship the log to elasticsearch. Any transformation of data will be done centrally in `logstash`. In other words we can hve as many `filebeat` installed as we have desktop running OpenSpan RDA. The picture below describe the architecture in place :

To make this solution working, here are the different elements of `filebeat-logstash-elastic-kibana` being used :

- `logstash` plugins : elapsed, date, csv
- `logstash` grok matching rules and regular expression.

## log files

In this example we have implemented both format : *RuntimeLog.txt* and *Runtime_Log4Net.txt*, you can find more information [here](./OpenSpan-logs.md)
